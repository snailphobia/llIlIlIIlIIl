# yet another way too complicated password manager

***

    the goal of this project is to provide a simple way to manage encrypted passwords
    and other sensitive data. it is not meant to be a replacement for a password manager

***

    it will store your passwords on a remote server, so you can access them from anywhere
    using only a this program and your master password

    it will encrypt your passwords using a master password and a salt, so you can't access
    them without the master password
